# AIVA
GPT-3.5 Turbo Based Virtual Agent that provides replies with user-provided data via PDF files

AIVA has an adjacent folder called trainingDocs. This folder contains pdf files which serve as the training
material. They can be anything from an HR manual to sample resumes, to even studies on the heart
anatomy.

In summary, this code creates a web-based chatbot interface using Gradio and utilizes the GPT-3.5
language model through the OpenAI API to provide intelligent responses to user queries. The index is
constructed to optimize response retrieval from the provided training documents.
